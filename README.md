# Odin Landing Page Template

This project is for a basic landing page mockup/template for a personal portfolio or a company website, as part of a lesson provided by  [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page).

## Overview

The goal for this project was to copy the layout as close as possible in the image provided.

Color and font styles were also included.

**Note: These were only guidelines and not strict rules. It was suggested to add personal touches and content.**

## Process

This project was provided in order to put the lessons on **HTML and CSS,especially flexbox,** into practice. I sticked with the provided layout to mainly focus on applying my understanding of flexbox without the stress of figuring out what contents to put in.

I approached this project tackling the layout of each section of the page:
- Navigation bar
- Hero section
- Information
- Quote
- Call to action
- Footer

Only after finishing the layout did I apply general styles like the colors, font and spacing.

## What I learned

I was able to apply flexbox in various layouts. The main take-away for me is how important planning is, before even writing any code. Dividing the page into sections and working on one layout before going to the next one helped me have a sense of flow.
